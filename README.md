# Modular YOLOv8 Optimization for Real-Time UAV Maritime Rescue Object Detection



This repository contains the configuration files and core code for the paper *Modular YOLOv8 Optimization for Real-Time UAV Maritime Rescue Object Detection*. The study is based on the YOLOv8 framework and proposes a modular optimization approach designed to improve real-time detection performance in UAV-based maritime rescue tasks. The provided code and configuration files can be used to reproduce the experimental results and support further research and extensions.



This project uses the **SeaDronesSee Object Detection** dataset, which is specifically designed for UAV-based maritime rescue scenarios. For more detailed information about the dataset, including download links and annotations, please refer to the following resources:
